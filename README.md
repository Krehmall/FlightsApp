## Flight App

In this App I used [React+Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) with **NodeJs** as base. 
This one was made with **Chakra**, which is have alot of ready components.
So there is no need to deal with **CSS+HTML**
I also used ***Router Provider***, and some base hooks like a ***UseState***.
To run this App [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) is required to be installed.


### How to run the App:

* Go to console in app directory enter command `npm i` 
* Then in console enter command `npm run dev` 
* In your browser follow the link that will appear in console 


### Description:

Simple login as pin code "*12345*"
At main page you see all "*Flights*" ,all **CRUD** funcs is availble here and sorting too.
