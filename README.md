This is my second React App i made.
I used React+Vite with NodeJs as base. 
This one was made with Redux ,which is managing "States" and work as database.
I also used React Icons and Router Provider, and some base hooks like a "UseState".


How to run the App:
1.Go to console in app directory enter command: npm i 
2.Then in console enter command: npm run dev 
3.In your browser follow the link that will appear in console 


Description: You can register and then login, all new users will be saved in store which is controlble with Redux.
At main page you see all "Todos" ,all CRUD funcs is availble here, you can see user page also.
