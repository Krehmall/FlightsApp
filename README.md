In this App I used React+Vite with NodeJs as base. 
This one was made with Chakra, which is have alot of ready components.
So there is no need to deal with SCC and HTML
I also used Router Provider, and some base hooks like a "UseState".


How to run the App:
1.Go to console in app directory enter command: npm i 
2.Then in console enter command: npm run dev 
3.In your browser follow the link that will appear in console 


Description: 
Simple login as pin code"12345"
At main page you see all "Flights" ,all CRUD funcs is availble here and sorting too.
